        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          You can start building more complex JavaScript statements by using
          conditional code. The conditional code allows you to ask if a
          condition is met. If the condition is met, a certain code block is
          run. If the condition isn't met, a different code block is run. The
          answer to the condition must always be a yes or no answer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Code_Format">
        <h2>Conditional Code Format</h2>
        <p>Here's the format of the conditional code:</p>
        <pre><code>                        
    //begin with an if statement
    if  ( condition ) {
    //insert code to run ...
    alert("Hello World");
    //otherwise, run this code
    } else {
    //end the code block
    }                        
                </code></pre>
        <p>
          The statement begins with if followed by a condition in parentheses.
          After the condition, the code block is run. Code blocks are contained
          within curly braces { }. The else means "if the previous condition
          isn't met, do this instead," or more simply, "Otherwise."
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example with some information:</p>
        <pre><code>
    //first declare a variable
    var a = 100;
    //state an if condition
    if ( a > 100 ) {
    //if true, then run this command
    alert("Hello");
    //if the condition isn't met, do this:
    } else {
    alert("Goodbye");
    }
                </code></pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Operators">
        <h2>Conditional Operators</h2>
        <p>
          In the condition statement, you can use a variety of operators to ask
          questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>if ( a == b) &nbsp;&nbsp; if a is equal to b</code></li>
          <li><code>if ( a !=b ) &nbsp;&nbsp; if a is not equal to b</code></li>
          <li><code>if ( a > b ) &nbsp;&nbsp; if a is greater than b</code></li>
          <li><code>if ( a &lt; b ) &nbsp;&nbsp; if a is less than b</code></li>
          <li>
            <code
              >if ( a >= b )&nbsp;&nbsp; if a is greater than or equal to
              b</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>
              if ( a &lt;= b )&nbsp;&nbsp; if a is less than or equal to b
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Equals_Signs">
        <h2>Equals Signs</h2>
        <p>
          Note that the equals operator is two equals signs ==, not one. When
          you set the value of a variable, you use one equals sign =. One equals
          sign means "assign as" whereas two equals signs means "equals".
        </p>

        <p>
          There's also a triple equals sign ===, which means "is strictly equal
          to." This is a more formal way of checking conditions. For example, if
          you have a variable that's a number, such as var a = 10, and another
          variable that's a string, such as var a = "10", the two variables are
          different types of variables and therefore aren't "strictly" equal,
          even though they're the same.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Nested_Conditions">
        <h2>Nested Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          You can nest multiple conditions. A nested condition looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    if  ( condition ) {
        //run some code...
        } else {
        if  ( condition ) {
        //run some code...
        } else {
        // otherwise, run this code
        }
                </code></pre>
        <p>
          Usually you don't nest more than a couple of condition levels, so that
          the code doesn't become too complicated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="And/Or_Operators">
        <h2>And/Or Operators</h2>
        <p>
          You can create more advanced conditions by including && (and) or ||
          (or) operators. Here's an example of the "and" operator:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    //if a is equal to b and a is equal to c
    if ( a == b && a == c )
                </code></pre>
        <p>Here's an example with "or" operator:</p>
        <pre><code>
    //if a is equal to be or a is equal to c
    if ( a == b || a == c )
                </code></pre>
        <p>
          For clarity, you can surround the conditions in their own parentheses,
          like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    if ( (a == b) && (a == c) )
                </code></pre>
        <p>
          Just remember that you always need both opening and closing
          parentheses. And just as with more simple conditional statements, the
          answer needs to be either yes or no.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Arithmetic_Operators">
        <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
        <p>You can use a variety of arithmetic operators:</p>
        <pre><code>
    + // add
    - //subtract
    * //multiple
    / //divide
    % // the remainder (the % is called a modulus)
                </code></pre>
